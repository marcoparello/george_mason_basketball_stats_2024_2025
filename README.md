# George Mason Basketball Stats For The 2024-2025 Season
Scrapes `omnirankings.com` and the `ESPN API` to retrieve the George Mason Basketball stats for the 2024-2025 season for the men's team and the women's team. Additionally, it reports the odds of the men's team and women's team winning a game. Secondarily, it reports offensive stats, defensive stats, home stats, away stats, overall stats, and individual player stats. Finally, it reports if the men's team or the women's team will make the NCAA tournament, and their chances of getting past the First Round, Second Round, Sweet 16, Elite 8, Final Four, and the National Championship game. 


This was developed as a passion project over winter break during my sophomore year of college.
